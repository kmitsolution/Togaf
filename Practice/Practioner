---

## **Scenario 1: Choosing the Correct ADM Phase**

### **Scenario**

A retail organization has approved its Target Architecture. Multiple solution options exist, but budget and resource constraints mean not all can be implemented at once.

### **Question**

What should the architect do NEXT?

A. Start implementation of the highest-value solution
B. Govern implementation for compliance
C. Identify and group changes into work packages and transition architectures
D. Manage architecture change requests

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** This is **Phase E – Opportunities & Solutions**.

---

## **Scenario 2: Phase F Decision Making**

### **Scenario**

Several work packages have been identified, but some depend on others and must be sequenced over 18 months.

### **Question**

Which activity is MOST appropriate?

A. Architecture compliance review
B. Prioritize and sequence work packages based on dependencies and value
C. Update architecture principles
D. Create a Solution Concept Diagram

✅ **Correct Answer:** B
**Why:** Sequencing and timing = **Phase F – Migration Planning**.

---

## **Scenario 3: Phase G vs Phase H**

### **Scenario**

During implementation, a development team proposes using a new cloud service that is not part of the approved Technology Architecture.

### **Question**

What should the Enterprise Architect do FIRST?

A. Approve the change to avoid delays
B. Trigger a new ADM cycle
C. Raise an Architecture Change Request
D. Update the Architecture Vision

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** Deviation is **identified in Phase G**; change request is raised.

---

## **Scenario 4: Handling the Change Request**

### **Scenario**

The proposed cloud service affects security, cost, and compliance across multiple systems.

### **Question**

Which phase should formally assess and decide on this change?

A. Phase F
B. Phase G
C. Phase H
D. Phase D

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** Impact assessment and decision = **Phase H**.

---

## **Scenario 5: Minor vs Major Change**

### **Scenario**

A UI color change is requested after go-live and does not affect architecture principles or target architecture.

### **Question**

What is the BEST action?

A. Ignore the request
B. Start a new ADM cycle
C. Handle as a minor change within Phase H and update the repository
D. Implement directly without governance

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** Minor changes are still managed in **Phase H**, but lightly.

---

## **Scenario 6: Requirements Management**

### **Scenario**

A new regulatory requirement arrives after the solution has been deployed.

### **Question**

What happens FIRST?

A. Restart Phase A
B. Implement the requirement immediately
C. Capture the requirement in Requirements Management
D. Perform architecture compliance review

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** All requirement changes go through **Requirements Management first**.

---

## **Scenario 7: Implementation Responsibility**

### **Scenario**

A stakeholder claims that Enterprise Architects should build and deploy the solution during Phase G.

### **Question**

What is the BEST response?

A. Correct, architects implement solutions in Phase G
B. Architects design and implement solutions
C. Delivery teams implement; architects govern compliance
D. Phase H teams implement solutions

✅ **Correct Answer:** C
**Why:** Phase G = **governance**, not implementation by architects.

---

## **Scenario 8: Transition Architecture Usage**

### **Scenario**

The organization must operate legacy and new systems in parallel for one year.

### **Question**

Which concept BEST describes this situation?

A. Baseline Architecture
B. Target Architecture
C. Transition Architecture
D. Solution Building Block

✅ **Correct Answer:** C

---

## **Scenario 9: Architecture Roadmap**

### **Scenario**

Delivery teams want to change implementation order due to local convenience.

### **Question**

Which artifact should the architect use to challenge this?

A. Architecture Vision
B. Architecture Roadmap
C. Business Capability Map
D. Architecture Principles

✅ **Correct Answer:** B

---

## **Scenario 10: ADM Restart Decision**

### **Scenario**

A merger introduces entirely new business capabilities and systems.

### **Question**

What is the MOST appropriate action?

A. Update Technology Architecture only
B. Handle as a minor change
C. Trigger a new ADM cycle from Phase A or Preliminary
D. Continue Phase G implementation

✅ **Correct Answer:** C

---

## 🧠 **Practitioner Exam Strategy (Very Important)**

In Practitioner:

* **Multiple answers may look correct**
* Choose the **BEST answer based on ADM intent**
* Ask yourself:

  * *Is this planning?* → Phase E/F
  * *Is this governance?* → Phase G
  * *Is this change?* → Phase H

## 🎯 Key Patterns to Remember

| Keyword in Question     | Think                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Options / Work packages | Phase E                 |
| Timeline / Sequencing   | Phase F                 |
| Compliance / Deviation  | Phase G                 |
| Change / Impact         | Phase H                 |
| New requirement         | Requirements Management |
