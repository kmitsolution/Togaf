## 🧠 **Exam Strategy (Very Important)**

* TOGAF Foundation is **conceptual**, not deep design
* Look for **keywords**:

  * *Vision* → Phase A
  * *Business* → Phase B
  * *Data & Application* → Phase C
  * *Technology* → Phase D
  * *Work packages* → Phase E
  * *Roadmap & plan* → Phase F
  * *Compliance* → Phase G
  * *Change* → Phase H
