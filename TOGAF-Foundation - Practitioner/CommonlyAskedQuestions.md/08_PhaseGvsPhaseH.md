---

## **1️⃣ High-Level Difference**

| Aspect        | **Phase G – Implementation Governance**                       | **Phase H – Architecture Change Management**                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Main Question | *Are we implementing according to the approved architecture?* | *How do we manage architectural change after implementation?* |
| Focus         | Governance during implementation                              | Managing architectural change                                 |
| Trigger       | Start of solution implementation                              | New business / technology changes or deviations               |
| Nature        | Control & compliance                                          | Evaluation & decision                                         |

## **2️⃣ Purpose Comparison**

### **Phase G**

* Govern solution implementation
* Ensure compliance with approved architecture
* Handle deviations through reviews and waivers

### **Phase H**

* Manage changes to architecture
* Assess impact of change requests
* Decide whether to update architecture or start a new ADM cycle

## **6️⃣ Simple Memory Trick (Very Important)**

* **Phase G = Govern the Build**
* **Phase H = Handle the Change**

or

* **G → Compliance**
* **H → Change Management**

---

## **7️⃣ Real-World Example**

### **Phase G**

* Dev team deploys code
* Architect checks compliance
* Deviation found → change request raised

### **Phase H**

* Change request assessed
* Decision made:

  * Minor update
  * Or start new ADM cycle

---

## **8️⃣ One-Line Exam Answers**

* **Phase G:** Ensures solution implementation complies with the approved architecture.
* **Phase H:** Manages architectural change to keep architecture aligned with business needs.

---

## **❗ Common Exam Trap**

❌ “Phase H governs implementation”
❌ “Phase G manages architectural change”

✅ Correct:

* **G governs implementation**
* **H manages architectural change**
