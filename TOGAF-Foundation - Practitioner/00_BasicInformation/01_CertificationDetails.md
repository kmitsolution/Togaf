# 📘 **TOGAF Practitioner (Level 2) – Exam Pattern**

---

## **1️⃣ Exam Objective**

The **TOGAF Practitioner exam** tests your ability to:

* **Apply TOGAF concepts**
* **Make correct decisions in scenarios**
* Understand **why** a phase, artifact, or action is correct

👉 It is **NOT definition-based** like Foundation.

---

## **2️⃣ Exam Format (Very Important)**

| Aspect                  | Details                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exam Type**           | Scenario-based, multiple-choice                         |
| **Number of Questions** | **8 questions**                                         |
| **Questions Style**     | Complex scenarios with multiple correct-looking options |
| **Time Limit**          | **90 minutes**                                          |
| **Open Book**           | ❌ No                                                    |
| **Delivery Mode**       | Online / Test Center                                    |

---

## **3️⃣ Question Style (Key Difference from Foundation)**

* Each question contains:

  * A **long scenario**
  * A **question**
  * **4 answer options**
* You must select the **BEST answer**, not just a correct one

📌 Often:

* 2 options are partially correct
* 1 option is clearly wrong
* 1 option is **MOST aligned with TOGAF ADM intent**

---

## **4️⃣ Scoring Method (Crucial for Passing)**

Each question is worth **5 points**
Maximum score = **40 points**

### **Scoring Per Question**

* Best answer → **5 points**
* Second-best answer → **3 points**
* Third-best answer → **1 point**
* Wrong answer → **0 points**

### **Passing Score**

* **60% = 24 out of 40 points**

📌 This means you **do NOT need all best answers** to pass.

---

## **5️⃣ Syllabus Focus Areas**

The Practitioner exam focuses heavily on:

### **ADM Phases**

* Phase A to Phase H
* Strong emphasis on:

  * Phase E (Opportunities & Solutions)
  * Phase F (Migration Planning)
  * Phase G (Implementation Governance)
  * Phase H (Architecture Change Management)

---

### **Key Concepts Tested**

* Requirements Management (continuous process)
* Governance vs Implementation
* Minor vs Major changes
* Transition Architectures
* Architecture Roadmaps
* Architecture Contracts
* Compliance reviews

---

## **6️⃣ What Is NOT Heavily Tested**

❌ Memorizing definitions
❌ Exact artifact lists
❌ Deep modeling notation

Instead, focus on:
✔ Decision-making
✔ Correct ADM phase selection
✔ Governance logic

---

## **7️⃣ Common Practitioner Exam Traps**

| Trap                               | Correct Thinking                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| “Implement change in Phase H”      | ❌ Phase H decides, Phase G implements |
| “Skip Phase B for speed”           | ❌ Use ADM tailoring, not skipping     |
| “Architects implement solutions”   | ❌ Architects govern, teams implement  |
| “Minor changes don’t need Phase H” | ❌ All changes go through Phase H      |

---

## **8️⃣ Practitioner Exam Strategy (Very Important)**

When reading a question, ask:

1. **Is this planning?** → Phase E / F
2. **Is this implementation & compliance?** → Phase G
3. **Is this change or new requirement?** → Phase H
4. **Is this vision & scope?** → Phase A

---

## **9️⃣ One-Line Summary (Exam Ready)**

**The TOGAF Practitioner exam evaluates your ability to apply TOGAF ADM concepts through scenario-based decision-making questions.**

* Architecture artifacts & building blocks
* Requirements Management

### **Practitioner Focus**

* Applying ADM in scenarios
* Phase E, F, G, H decision making
* Governance vs implementation
* Minor vs major change
* Architecture Roadmaps & Transition Architectures

---

## **6️⃣ Common Exam Traps (Combined Exam)**

❌ “Phase H implements solutions”
❌ “Architects build the solution”
❌ “Minor changes skip Phase H”

✅ Correct understanding:

* Phase G → Govern implementation
* Phase H → Manage change
* Requirements Management → Continuous
