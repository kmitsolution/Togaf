## **Implementation Governance Model**

### **Overview**

* The **Implementation Governance Model (IGM)** ensures that the **execution of architecture projects** is properly governed, controlled, and aligned with the **Target Architecture**.
* It provides a framework for **monitoring progress, managing change, and ensuring compliance** during migration and implementation.
* Acts as a **bridge between architecture design (Phases Eâ€“F)** and **execution (Phase G)**.

---

### **Definition**

* The IGM defines **how implementation activities are directed and controlled** to stay consistent with the enterprise architecture.
* It outlines **roles, responsibilities, decision rights, and governance mechanisms** that oversee implementation.
* Focuses on maintaining **architectural integrity** while enabling flexibility during execution.

---

### **Structure**

A typical Implementation Governance Model includes:

1. **Governance Principles**

   * Core rules and policies guiding implementation consistency.
   * Ensures accountability and transparency.

2. **Governance Bodies**

   * **Architecture Board:** approves deviations, manages compliance.
   * **Project Steering Committees:** oversee project-level alignment.
   * **Change Control Board:** evaluates scope or design changes.

3. **Processes and Controls**

   * Regular **architecture compliance reviews**.
   * Change management and escalation processes.
   * Performance monitoring and risk management mechanisms.

4. **Reporting and Communication**

   * Clear channels for **status reporting and feedback**.
   * Integration with **program and portfolio management offices**.

### **Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* Developed during **Phase F** to prepare governance for implementation.
* **Applied in Phase G (Implementation Governance)** to monitor and ensure compliance.
* **Updated in Phase H (Architecture Change Management)** for continuous improvement.

---

### **Benefits**

* Ensures **consistency** between architecture and actual implementation.
* Reduces **risks of deviation** from the target design.
* Strengthens **stakeholder confidence** in architecture-driven transformation.
* Provides a clear **governance structure for decision-making and accountability**.
* Enables **continuous traceability** between architecture goals and project outcomes.
