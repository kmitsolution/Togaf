# **📘 Phase F – Migration Planning Artifacts (TOGAF ADM)**

Phase F focuses on **time-based planning**, so most artifacts help answer **when, in what order, and at what cost** the solutions will be implemented.

---

## **1️⃣ Roadmaps**

### **✔ Architecture Roadmap (Refined)**

* Time-based view of implementation
* Shows **work packages**, **transition architectures**, and **target architecture**
* Usually organized by **phases or increments**

👉 This is the **key artifact of Phase F**.

---

## **2️⃣ Implementation & Migration Plan**

### **✔ Implementation and Migration Plan**

* Detailed plan for executing work packages
* Includes:

  * Schedule
  * Dependencies
  * Risks
  * Costs
  * Resources

This plan is more detailed than Phase E planning.

---

## **3️⃣ Matrices**

### **✔ Work Package Dependency Matrix**

* Shows dependencies between work packages
* Helps determine correct sequencing

---

### **✔ Business Value Assessment Matrix**

* Compares work packages based on:

  * Business value
  * Risk
  * Cost
  * Strategic alignment

---

## **4️⃣ Transition Artifacts**

### **✔ Transition Architecture Definitions (Updated)**

* Intermediate states between Baseline and Target
* Refined and sequenced for execution

---

## **5️⃣ Risk & Impact Artifacts**

### **✔ Implementation Risk Assessment**

* Identifies risks during migration
* Includes mitigation strategies

---

### **✔ Impact Analysis**

* Impact on:

  * Business operations
  * Applications
  * Technology
  * People & processes

---

## **6️⃣ Cost & Benefit Artifacts**

### **✔ Cost/Benefit Analysis**

* Estimates implementation costs
* Compares benefits across work packages
* Supports prioritization decisions
