## **Phase F: Migration Planning**

### **Overview**

* **Phase F** finalizes the **Implementation and Migration Plan** initiated in Phase E.
* It defines how the enterprise will **transition from the Baseline Architecture to the Target Architecture** through coordinated projects and programs.
* The focus is on **prioritization, sequencing, and governance** of implementation activities.

---

### **Purpose**

* To **finalize a detailed Implementation and Migration Plan** for executing the Target Architecture.
* To estimate the **resources**, **timeframes**, and **budget** required for transformation.
* To ensure that migration aligns with **business priorities**, **risk appetite**, and **organizational capacity for change**.
* To deliver an **approved set of projects and transition architectures** ready for execution.
