## **Phase F: Migration Planning â€“ Approach**

### **Overview**

* The approach in Phase F provides guidance for **transitioning from architecture design to implementation execution**.
* It ensures the **Implementation and Migration Plan** is **approved, realistic, and aligned** with enterprise priorities.
* Phase F closes the **architecture development cycle** and hands over control to **implementation governance** (Phase G).

### **Core Activities**

1. **Integrate Architecture Roadmap with Business Planning**

   * Align with organizational strategy, portfolio, and budgeting cycles.
   * Validate business case, timing, and dependencies.

2. **Consolidate Deliverables from Previous Phases**

   * Finalize outputs from Phase E such as:

     * Architecture Roadmap
     * Implementation and Migration Plan
     * Transition Architectures
   * Ensure consistency across domains (business, application, data, and technology).

3. **Confirm Governance Structures**

   * Establish oversight mechanisms for project delivery.
   * Prepare for **architecture compliance reviews** and decision checkpoints.

4. **Finalize Resource Planning**

   * Validate cost, resource, and schedule estimates.
   * Identify delivery mechanisms (internal teams, vendors, partnerships).

5. **Stakeholder Communication and Buy-in**

   * Secure formal approval of the Implementation and Migration Plan.
   * Manage stakeholder expectations regarding benefits, risks, and timelines.

6. **Transition to Implementation Governance (Phase G)**

   * Transfer approved projects to execution.
   * Handover key documents: Architecture Definition, Roadmap, and Governance Model.
   * Ensure clear accountability for realization and compliance.
