## **Architecture Alternatives & Trade-offs â€“ Definition**

In many cases, **multiple Target Architectures** can satisfy the enterprise vision, principles, and requirements. A single architecture may not fully address all stakeholder concerns.

**Purpose:**

* Identify **alternative Target Architectures**.
* Build an understanding of **different possibilities**.
* Identify **trade-offs** between alternatives (competing forces such as cost, performance, or complexity).
* Reveal **hidden agendas, principles, or requirements** by presenting alternatives to stakeholders.

This process helps ensure that the architecture balances stakeholder needs and aligns with enterprise objectives.

## **Technique for Architecture Alternatives & Trade-offs**

1. **Select Criteria:**

   * Use vision, principles, requirements, and other information to define evaluation criteria for alternatives.

2. **Define and Analyze Alternatives:**

   * Develop multiple architecture options based on the selected criteria.
   * Build understanding of the benefits, risks, and implications of each alternative.

3. **Select or Combine Alternatives:**

   * Choose a single alternative or **combine features** from multiple alternatives to create the proposed Target Architecture.

This approach ensures that architecture decisions are **transparent, justified, and aligned with enterprise goals**, while also balancing competing stakeholder concerns.
