## **Architecture Maturity Models and Capability Assessments**

### **Overview**

* **Maturity Models** help measure how well an organization’s architecture function is defined, managed, and integrated with business strategy.
* **Capability Assessments** evaluate the **current state of architecture practices**, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
* Together, they provide a structured approach for **continuous improvement** of enterprise architecture (EA).

---

### **Purpose**

* To assess **how effectively architecture is practiced and governed** within the enterprise.
* To identify **gaps** between current and desired capability levels.
* To guide **investment decisions** for developing EA skills, tools, and governance.
* To support **roadmapping of EA maturity improvements** over time.

### **Architecture Maturity Model**

A typical **EA Maturity Model** includes multiple levels (usually five):

1. **Initial (Ad Hoc)**

   * Architecture activities are unstructured and reactive.
   * No formal governance or standards exist.

2. **Repeatable**

   * Some processes and roles are defined, but application is inconsistent.
   * Early stages of architecture documentation and reuse.

3. **Defined**

   * Architecture processes are standardized and integrated with project management.
   * Governance structures are established.

4. **Managed**

   * Architecture performance is measured and managed.
   * Active governance and compliance mechanisms are in place.

5. **Optimized**

   * Continuous improvement and innovation in architecture management.
   * Architecture is fully aligned with enterprise strategy and transformation goals.

### **Architecture Capability Assessment**

* A structured method for evaluating **architecture maturity across multiple dimensions**, such as:

  * **Architecture Process** – defined ADM usage and integration.
  * **Architecture Development** – quality and completeness of deliverables.
  * **Governance and Compliance** – consistency and adherence to principles.
  * **Tools and Repository** – use of architecture tools and knowledge management.
  * **People and Skills** – competencies and experience of architecture teams.
  * **Integration with Business Strategy** – degree of alignment with enterprise goals.

---

### **Benefits**

* Enables **objective measurement** of EA effectiveness.
* Supports **benchmarking** against industry standards or frameworks.
* Identifies **improvement opportunities** for the EA function.
* Helps **justify investments** in architecture governance, skills, or tools.
* Builds a **foundation for continuous capability improvement**.

---

### **Outcome**

* A **Capability Assessment Report** highlighting:

  * Current maturity level per domain.
  * Target maturity goals.
  * Recommended actions and improvement roadmap.
* Forms part of the **Architecture Capability Framework**, feeding into **governance and performance management** processes.
