## **ADM – Information Flow Between Phases**

### **Key Concepts**

* The ADM is **not a linear waterfall process**; it is **iterative and adaptive**.
* Each ADM phase produces **outputs** necessary to develop the architecture, while consuming **inputs** from previous phases, external sources, or repositories.

### **Information Flow Principles**

1. **Input–Output Relationship:**

   * Every phase consumes inputs to generate outputs.
   * Outputs of one phase can serve as inputs for later phases.
   * Outputs can also be **updated or refined** in subsequent phases.

2. **Flexible Work Plans:**

   * The work plan of the Enterprise Architecture team depends on the **problem and development task**.
   * Each **Request for Architecture Work** defines a distinct ADM path, scope, and required outputs.

3. **Iterative Refinement:**

   * ADM supports iterative improvement: outputs can be **revisited, detailed, or extended** in later phases based on new requirements or insights.

## **Building Block Specification Process**

### **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs) and Solution Building Blocks (SBBs)**

* ABBs are **defined in Phases A, B, C, and D**.
* ABBs are refined into **Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) in Phase E**.

### **Process Steps**

1. **Identify Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)**

   * Determine which ABBs are required to meet business goals and objectives.

2. **Refine ABBs into SBBs**

   * Select or develop SBBs to implement the identified ABBs.
   * SBBs can be **purchased off-the-shelf or custom-developed** based on required functions, constraints, and available products.

### **Nature of the Process**

* Evolutionary and iterative, adapting to:

  * Business needs and goals
  * Imposed constraints
  * Available technology and products

This summary shows how **information flows between ADM phases** and how **ABBs evolve into SBBs**, highlighting the iterative, adaptive nature of TOGAF.

I can now **create a full, consolidated TOGAF ADM reference sheet** combining:

* Requirements Management
* Phases G & H
* Compliance Assessment
* Change Requests & Impact Assessment
* Iterations
* Information Flow & Building Blocks
