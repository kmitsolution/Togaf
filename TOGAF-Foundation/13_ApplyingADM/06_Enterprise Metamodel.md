## **Enterprise Metamodel**

### **Definition**

* The **Enterprise Metamodel** defines the **structure and relationships** of architecture content — how information about architectures is **organized, categorized, and linked**.
* It acts as a **data model for architecture artifacts** across all ADM phases.

---

### **Purpose**

* Provides a **consistent way to describe and connect architecture artifacts** (e.g., principles, objectives, building blocks).
* Ensures **semantic consistency** and supports **traceability** between architectural elements.
* Enables **integration with modeling tools** and repositories.

---

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Entities and Relationships**

   * Entities include elements such as *Business Process*, *Application Component*, *Technology Platform*, etc.
   * Relationships show how these elements **interact and depend on each other**.

2. **Domains and Layers**

   * The metamodel aligns with TOGAF’s architecture domains:

     * **Business Architecture**
     * **Data Architecture**
     * **Application Architecture**
     * **Technology Architecture**

3. **Traceability Links**

   * Enable connections between requirements, architecture elements, and implementations.
   * Example: *Requirement → Function → Application → Technology Component.*

4. **Specialization and Customization**

   * Organizations can **extend or tailor** the metamodel to suit their own needs.
   * Customization ensures the metamodel reflects enterprise-specific terminology or frameworks.

## **Architecture Repository**

### **Definition**

* The **Architecture Repository** serves as the **central storage and management system** for all architecture assets, artifacts, and deliverables.
* It supports **reuse, governance, and version control** of architecture work.

### **Components of the Architecture Repository**

1. **Architecture Metamodel** – defines the structure of architecture information.
2. **Architecture Capability Framework** – governs architecture practice and processes.
3. **Architecture Landscape** – current and target architecture states.
4. **Standards Information Base (SIB)** – approved technical and business standards.
5. **Reference Library** – best practices, models, and templates.
6. **Governance Log** – records compliance assessments and architecture decisions.
7. **Architecture Requirements Repository** – stores all business and technical requirements.

---

### **Benefits**

* Ensures **consistency, reusability, and accessibility** of architecture artifacts.
* Facilitates **governance and change management**.
* Improves **collaboration** across architecture teams.
* Enables **historical tracking** of architectural evolution and decision-making.
* Supports **alignment between architecture design and implementation**.
