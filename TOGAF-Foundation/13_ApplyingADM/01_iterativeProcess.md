## **ADM Iterations – Iterative Approach**

The **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** is inherently **iterative**, allowing architecture development to be refined progressively.

### **Iteration Scope**

The ADM can iterate in three ways:

1. **Over the whole ADM process** – repeat the full cycle to refine or expand the architecture.
2. **Between phases** – revisit earlier phases as needed based on new information or changing requirements.
3. **Within phases** – perform mini-iterations to refine outputs before moving to the next phase.

---

### **Iteration Characteristics**

Each iteration represents a new set of decisions regarding:

* **Breadth of enterprise coverage** – which parts of the enterprise are included.
* **Level of detail** – how detailed the architecture models and specifications should be.
* **Time horizon** – the period the architecture iteration is aimed at covering.
* **Use of existing architectural assets** – leverage previously created or externally available artifacts.

---

### **Decision Factors**

The scope and focus of each iteration are determined by:

* **Availability of resources and competence** – can the organization support the iteration?
* **Value to the enterprise** – what business benefit will the chosen scope deliver?

---

This iterative approach allows ADM to remain **flexible, responsive, and value-driven**, ensuring that architecture evolves in alignment with business needs and available resources.

## **ADM Iterations – Practice**

### **Project-Specific Iteration**

* Each **Architecture Project** begins with **Phase A (Architecture Vision)** and follows its own ADM path.
* Iterations are necessary due to:

  * **High complexity** – to manage enterprise-wide complexity.
  * **Interdependencies** – to consider the entire architecture, existing gaps, and resulting work simultaneously.
* Each project:

  * Has a **distinct purpose**.
  * Traverses a **distinct path**.
  * Uses a **different ADM configuration**.

### **Information-Driven Iterations**

* Iterations are driven by the **information needs** of the project.
* Not all ADM phases need to be executed if information is unnecessary or already produced.
* **ADM phases and steps can be executed simultaneously** and repeated as required.
* Multiple phases may remain **open concurrently** to provide required breadth, depth, timing, and recency of architecture outputs.

## **ADM Iteration Types**

1. **Iteration Through the Entire ADM**

   * Develops a **comprehensive Enterprise Architecture Landscape**.
   * Each project goes through the full ADM cycle (starting with Phase A and a **Request for Architecture Work**).
   * Output from each project **changes or extends** the Architecture Landscape.
   * Iterations can be:

     * **Parallel** – separate projects operate concurrently with interrelationships.
     * **Sequential** – a project triggers another if it identifies new opportunities, solutions, or EA landscape impacts outside the original Request for Architecture Work.

2. **Architecture Development Iteration**

   * Iteration **within an ADM cycle**.
   * Projects may:

     * Operate **multiple phases concurrently** to manage interrelated BDAT architectures.
     * Cycle between phases to converge on a **detailed Target Architecture** when only higher-level architecture exists.
     * Return to previous phases to **update work products** or converge on an **Architecture Roadmap** or Implementation & Migration Plan when requirements change.

3. **Architecture Capability Iteration**

   * Creates and evolves the **Architecture Capability**.
   * Projects may require a **new iteration of the Preliminary Phase** to:

     * Establish or re-establish aspects of the Architecture Capability identified in Phase A.
     * Adjust the Architecture Capability based on **new or changed requirements** (triggered by a Change Request in Phase H).

4. **Architecture Governance Iteration**

   * Supports governance of **change activities**, ensuring architecture compliance and alignment during iterations.

5. **Transition Planning Iteration**

   * Creates **change roadmaps** for a defined architecture, coordinating implementation steps with business priorities.

---

### **Key Points**

* ADM iterations enable **concurrent execution of multiple phases** and **flexible revisiting** of previous phases.
* Iterations allow architecture development to **progress incrementally**, adapting to new information, requirements, or gaps.
* They provide a **mechanism to manage complexity, interdependencies, and evolving enterprise needs** while maintaining alignment with business objectives.
