## **ADM Iterations – Iterative Approach**

The **Architecture Development Method (ADM)** is inherently **iterative**, allowing architecture development to be refined progressively.

### **Iteration Scope**

The ADM can iterate in three ways:

1. **Over the whole ADM process** – repeat the full cycle to refine or expand the architecture.
2. **Between phases** – revisit earlier phases as needed based on new information or changing requirements.
3. **Within phases** – perform mini-iterations to refine outputs before moving to the next phase.

### **Iteration Characteristics**

Each iteration represents a new set of decisions regarding:

* **Breadth of enterprise coverage** – which parts of the enterprise are included.
* **Level of detail** – how detailed the architecture models and specifications should be.
* **Time horizon** – the period the architecture iteration is aimed at covering.
* **Use of existing architectural assets** – leverage previously created or externally available artifacts.

---

### **Decision Factors**

The scope and focus of each iteration are determined by:

* **Availability of resources and competence** – can the organization support the iteration?
* **Value to the enterprise** – what business benefit will the chosen scope deliver?

---

This iterative approach allows ADM to remain **flexible, responsive, and value-driven**, ensuring that architecture evolves in alignment with business needs and available resources.
