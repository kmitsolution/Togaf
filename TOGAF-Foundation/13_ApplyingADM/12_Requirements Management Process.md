## **Requirements Management**

### **Overview**

* **Requirements Management** is a **central process** in the TOGAF ADM that ensures **requirements are identified, documented, and addressed** throughout all ADM phases.
* It acts as a **continuous feedback loop**, managing changing requirements and maintaining alignment with architecture objectives.
* The process ensures that architecture remains **relevant, consistent, and traceable** as business needs evolve.

---

### **Purpose**

* To manage **architecture requirements systematically** across the entire ADM cycle.
* To ensure all requirements are **traceable to business goals** and architectural deliverables.
* To **validate and verify** that implemented solutions fulfill the defined requirements.
* To provide **control and governance** over changes in requirements.

### **Key Objectives**

1. Identify and document all **business, data, application, and technology requirements**.
2. Maintain **traceability** between requirements and architecture artifacts.
3. Evaluate the **impact of new or changing requirements** on existing architectures.
4. Ensure **requirements are addressed** at the right phase of the ADM cycle.
5. Provide **feedback and updates** to architecture development as the enterprise evolves.

### **Requirements Management Cycle**

1. **Identify Requirements** – capture business drivers, stakeholder needs, and constraints.
2. **Store and Categorize** – manage requirements in the **Architecture Repository**.
3. **Assess and Prioritize** – evaluate importance, urgency, and dependencies.
4. **Allocate to ADM Phases** – assign requirements to appropriate phases (B–H).
5. **Implement and Track** – monitor fulfillment during solution delivery.
6. **Review and Update** – refine as changes occur; feed back into the cycle.

### **Integration with ADM**

* **Central to all phases** — represented as a continuous circle around the ADM cycle.
* Every ADM phase both **creates new requirements** and **consumes existing ones**.
* **Change requests** are evaluated and may trigger new ADM iterations or refinements.
* Ensures **architecture agility and responsiveness** to business change.

---

### **Outputs**

* **Requirements Repository** – comprehensive store of all requirements and their status.
* **Requirements Impact Assessments** – analysis of how new or modified requirements affect architecture.
* **Change Requests** – formal proposals for architecture modifications.

---

### **Benefits**

* Promotes **consistency and control** over evolving architecture needs.
* Maintains **alignment between business goals and technology execution**.
* Ensures **traceability, transparency, and governance** of all requirements.
* Supports **continuous improvement** and adaptability in enterprise architecture.
