## **Architecture Content Framework**

### **Overview**

* The **Architecture Content Framework (ACF)** provides a **structured model** for organizing and describing **architectural deliverables, artifacts, and building blocks** created during the TOGAF ADM.
* It defines **what content** the architecture work should produce and **how it is related**.
* The ACF ensures **consistency and traceability** across all ADM phases.

---

### **Purpose**

* To define a **common language** for describing architecture outputs.
* To provide **a standard structure** for all architecture deliverables (e.g., diagrams, matrices, catalogs).
* To enable **reusability, governance, and alignment** across the enterprise.
* To support **integration with repositories, metamodels, and the enterprise continuum**.

---

### **Key Components**

1. **Deliverables**

   * Work products that are formally reviewed and approved (e.g., Architecture Definition Document, Implementation and Migration Plan).
   * Represent **the “what”** is delivered.

2. **Artifacts**

   * Detailed architectural work products such as **models, diagrams, or catalogs**.
   * Represent **the “how”** architecture is expressed (e.g., Data Model, Application Communication Diagram).

3. **Building Blocks**

   * **Reusable components** that can appear in multiple architectures.
   * Two types:

     * **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs):** Define logical capabilities and standards.
     * **Solution Building Blocks (SBBs):** Define physical or implemented components.

---

### **Explanation**

* The ACF **integrates** all architecture domains (business, data, application, and technology).
* Provides **traceability** between **requirements → architecture → solutions**.
* Supports the **Architecture Repository**, ensuring consistent documentation and storage.
* Acts as the **foundation** for modeling tools and metamodels.

---

### **Benefits**

* Ensures **standardization** and **consistency** of architecture deliverables.
* Improves **communication** and understanding between stakeholders.
* Enables **re-use** of architectural assets across projects and domains.
* Facilitates **integration** with governance and repository tools.
* Provides a **reference model** for documenting architectures at all levels (strategic, segment, capability).
