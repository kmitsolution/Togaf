## **ADM – Phase H: Architecture Change Management – Approach**

Phase H defines how changes to the architecture are **managed, assessed, and implemented**.

---

### **Approach (1/2) – Process Overview**

* The **change management process** defines:

  * **When and how the enterprise architecture (EA)** or parts of it can change after implementation.
  * **How a new ADM cycle** may be triggered to develop an updated architecture.
* **Establish criteria based on business value** to determine whether a Change Request:

  * Warrants an **architecture update**.
  * Warrants **starting a new ADM cycle**.

---

### **Approach (2/2) – Change Request Content & Classification**

**Content of a Change Request:**

1. Description of the proposed change
2. Rationale for the proposed change
3. Impact assessment of the proposed change

**Change Classification:**

* **Simplification Change:** Minor adjustments handled through normal change management.
* **Incremental Change:** Moderate updates that may require partial re-architecting.
* **Re-architecting Change:** Significant changes requiring a **new architecture development cycle**.

---

This approach ensures that changes are **controlled, justified, and aligned with business value**, preventing unnecessary or disruptive updates while allowing flexibility for needed improvements.
