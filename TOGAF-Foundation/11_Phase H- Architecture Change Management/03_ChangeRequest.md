## **ADM – Phase H: Architecture Change Management – Architectural Inputs**

Phase H is **triggered by change requests** that require the architecture to adapt during implementation. These requests can come from both **technology** and **business** sources.

### **Technology Change Inputs**

* Change Requests related to technology
* New technology reports
* Asset management or cost reduction initiatives
* Technology withdrawal reports
* Standardization initiatives

### **Business Change Inputs**

* Business-related change requests
* Business developments or exceptions
* Business innovations
* Business-technology innovations
* Strategic change developments

## **Change Request – Definition**

A **Change Request** proposes an extension or refinement of the architecture during implementation.

**Characteristics:**

* Describes deviations from the suggested architectural approach (scope, requirements, solution, or definition).
* Triggered by new knowledge or external factors (e.g., market changes, business strategy adjustments, new technology opportunities).
* Initiates a **new cycle of architecture work**.

**Purpose:**

* Describe and justify the proposed change.
* Provide an **impact assessment**, referencing requirements, stakeholder priorities, affected phases, and recommendations.
* Include a repository reference number for tracking.

## **Change Request – Structure**

* Captured in a **structured format** (following TOGAF templates).
* Includes:

  * Description and rationale
  * Impact assessment
  * References to requirements, priorities, and affected ADM phases

## **Change Request – ADM Phase Usage**

* **Created and documented in Phases F (Migration Planning) & G (Implementation Governance).**
* **Assessed in Phase H** for architecture updates or to trigger a new ADM cycle.
* Used for:

  * Architecture Capability updates based on lessons learned
  * Inputs to existing business programs and projects
  * Decision-making for implementing changes
