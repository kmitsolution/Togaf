1. **Establish Value Realization Process**

   * Define how the architecture’s value will be measured and tracked.

2. **Deploy Monitoring Tools**

   * Implement tools to monitor performance, compliance, and gaps.

3. **Manage Risks**

   * Identify and mitigate risks associated with architecture changes.

4. **Provide Analysis for Architecture Change Management**

   * Analyze gaps, issues, and opportunities for improvements.

5. **Develop Change Requirements**

   * Specify changes needed to meet performance targets or business objectives.

6. **Manage Governance Process**

   * Ensure changes are reviewed, approved, and controlled according to the Architecture Governance Framework.

7. **Activate the Process to Implement Change**

   * Put approved changes into action within the enterprise architecture.
