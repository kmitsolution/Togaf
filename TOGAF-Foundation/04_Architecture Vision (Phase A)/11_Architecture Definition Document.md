**TOGAF ADM ‚Äì Phase A: Architecture Vision**

---

#### **1. Definition**

* The **Architecture Definition Document (ADD)** provides a **comprehensive view** of the architecture across all domains:

  * **Business**, **Data**, **Application**, and **Technology**.
* It describes the **baseline (current state)** and **target (future state)** architectures.
* Acts as a **primary deliverable** to communicate architectural decisions and structure to stakeholders.

---

#### **2. Purpose**

* To **define and describe** the architecture that will meet business requirements.
* To ensure **traceability** from business goals to architectural solutions.
* To form the **foundation for design, implementation, and governance**.
* To enable **evaluation of compliance and impact** during architecture realization.

---

#### **3. Structure**

A typical Architecture Definition Document includes:

1. **Executive Summary**

   * Purpose, scope, and key findings.
2. **Architecture Context**

   * Overview of business goals, drivers, and principles.
3. **Architecture Domains**

   * **Business Architecture:** organization, processes, capabilities.
   * **Data Architecture:** data entities, relationships, management principles.
   * **Application Architecture:** application services, interactions, and flows.
   * **Technology Architecture:** platforms, infrastructure, and standards.
4. **Baseline Architecture Description**

   * Current state of the enterprise‚Äôs architecture landscape.
5. **Target Architecture Description**

   * Future desired architecture state.
6. **Gap Analysis Summary**

   * Key differences between baseline and target states.
7. **Impact Analysis**

   * Dependencies, risks, and constraints.
8. **Appendices**

   * Supporting diagrams, catalogs, and matrices (as per TOGAF content framework).

---

#### **4. Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* **Created:** Mainly in **Phase A** and extended in **Phases B, C, and D**.
* **Inputs:**

  * Architecture Vision
  * Architecture Requirements Specification
  * Business Principles, Goals, and Drivers
* **Outputs:**

  * Detailed view of baseline and target architectures.
  * Source for **Architecture Roadmap** and **Implementation Plans**.
* **Used in:**

  * Validation of design decisions.
  * Architecture compliance assessments.
  * Stakeholder communication and governance reviews.

#### **5. Relationship to Other Deliverables**

| Deliverable                                 | Relationship                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture Vision**                     | Provides the high-level summary (the ‚Äúwhat and why‚Äù).                              |
| **Architecture Definition Document**        | Provides detailed structure and design (the ‚Äúwhat and how‚Äù).                       |
| **Architecture Requirements Specification** | Defines constraints and measures of success.                                       |
| **Statement of Architecture Work**          | Defines project scope, plan, and responsibilities for developing the architecture. |

#### **6. Key Takeaways for Exam**

* The **ADD** provides the **formal description** of both baseline and target architectures.
* It ensures **consistency and traceability** across ADM phases.
* It is **domain-structured** (Business, Data, Application, Technology).
* Acts as the **basis for implementation and governance** in later phases.

---

‚úÖ **In summary:**
The *Architecture Definition Document* is a central TOGAF deliverable that describes the enterprise‚Äôs current and target architecture in detail. It supports communication, alignment, and governance throughout the ADM lifecycle and connects strategic goals with architectural realization.
