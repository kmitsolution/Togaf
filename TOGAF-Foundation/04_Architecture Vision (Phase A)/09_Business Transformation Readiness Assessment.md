---

#### **1. Definition**

* The **Business Transformation Readiness Assessment (BTRA)** measures how **prepared an enterprise is** to execute major transformation or change initiatives.
* It helps determine whether the **organizationâ€™s culture, structures, and resources** can successfully support the implementation of the architecture vision.
* Provides insight into **risks, dependencies, and required interventions** before change begins.

#### **2. Motivation**

* Even the best-designed architectures can fail if the organization is not ready for transformation.
* Readiness varies based on:

  * Leadership commitment
  * Change management capability
  * Resource availability
  * Cultural openness to change
* The assessment **reduces transformation risks** and informs realistic planning.

#### **3. Approach**

A **structured evaluation** that:

2. Uses **qualitative and quantitative metrics** (e.g., scoring models, interviews).
3. Highlights **areas needing improvement**.
4. Recommends **actions** to increase readiness before initiating ADM Phases Bâ€“H.

Common factors assessed:
