### ðŸ§­ Architecture Requirements Specification

**TOGAF ADM â€“ Phase A: Architecture Vision**

---

#### **1. Definition**

* The **Architecture Requirements Specification (ARS)** is a deliverable that:

  * Provides a **complete statement of all requirements** for the architecture work.
  * Ensures that all **business, data, application, and technology requirements** are captured and aligned.
  * Acts as a **bridge between business needs and solution design**.
  * Forms the **basis for measuring success** of the architecture effort.

---

#### **2. Purpose**

* To **define, structure, and communicate** the requirements for the target architecture.
* To ensure that:

  * All stakeholder needs are captured and validated.
  * The architecture satisfies the enterpriseâ€™s strategic and operational objectives.
  * Requirements remain **traceable** across ADM phases.

---

#### **3. Structure**

Typically includes:

1. **Introduction**

   * Background, scope, and objectives of the architecture.
2. **Requirements Summary**

   * Grouped by architecture domain (Business, Data, Application, Technology).
3. **Detailed Requirements**

   * Functional and non-functional (e.g., performance, security, compliance).
4. **Prioritization**

   * Classified as mandatory, essential, or desirable.
5. **Traceability Matrix**

   * Links requirements to business drivers and goals.
6. **Compliance and Constraints**

   * External or internal policies impacting architecture.

#### **4. Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* **Created:** Primarily in **Phase A (Architecture Vision)**.
* **Used and Updated:** Continuously through **Phases Bâ€“H** to track requirements.
* Acts as a **control mechanism** to:

  * Validate architecture deliverables.
  * Support change management and impact analysis.
* Feeds into the **Requirements Repository** for reuse in later cycles.

---

#### **5. Key Points for Exam**

* ARS **documents what the architecture must achieve** â€“ not how it will be implemented.
* Ensures **alignment between business goals** and the resulting architecture.
* Supports **Requirements Management (central to ADM)** across all phases.
* Used to **measure architecture compliance and project success**.

---

âœ… **In summary:**
The *Architecture Requirements Specification* is a crucial deliverable in TOGAF ADM Phase A that defines, organizes, and manages architecture requirements. It ensures that every architectural decision remains aligned with enterprise goals and stakeholder expectations.
