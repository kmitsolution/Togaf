### ðŸ§­  Capability Assessment

**TOGAF ADM â€“ Phase A: Architecture Vision**

---

#### **1. Definition**

* A **Capability Assessment** evaluates the **enterpriseâ€™s ability** to execute change through architecture work.
* It identifies **strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and risks** related to people, processes, and tools.
* The goal is to ensure that the organization has the **necessary maturity and readiness** to implement and sustain architectural change.

---

#### **2. Purpose**

* To **understand current capabilities** that support architecture development and transformation.
* To **identify capability gaps** that may hinder project success.
* To **inform planning and risk mitigation** in the Architecture Vision.
* To **guide the improvement** of enterprise architecture maturity over time.

#### **3. Capability Dimensions**

A Capability Assessment typically examines:

| Dimension        | Description                                                       |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Organization** | Structures, governance, and roles supporting architecture.        |
| **People**       | Skills, competencies, and capacity for architectural work.        |
| **Processes**    | Defined methods and repeatable procedures.                        |
| **Tools**        | Software and technology used to develop and manage architectures. |
| **Culture**      | Enterprise mindset toward innovation, governance, and change.     |

#### **4. Structure**

A typical **Capability Assessment report** includes:

1. **Introduction & Objectives**
2. **Assessment Scope**
3. **Capability Maturity Levels** (e.g., using a maturity model)
4. **Findings & Analysis** â€“ strengths, weaknesses, gaps
5. **Recommendations**
6. **Impact on ADM Activities** â€“ how capability gaps affect architecture development

---

#### **5. Capability Maturity Model (Example)**

* **Level 1 â€“ Initial:** Ad-hoc, unmanaged processes.
* **Level 2 â€“ Repeatable:** Some processes defined but inconsistently applied.
* **Level 3 â€“ Defined:** Standardized and documented architecture practices.
* **Level 4 â€“ Managed:** Quantitatively measured and monitored.
* **Level 5 â€“ Optimized:** Continuous improvement and proactive management.

---

#### **6. Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* Conducted in **Phase A (Architecture Vision)** to assess organizational capability.
* Inputs: existing architecture capability data, stakeholder feedback, previous assessments.
* Outputs: recommendations that feed into:

  * **Business Transformation Readiness Assessment**
  * **Statement of Architecture Work**
  * **Architecture Vision** deliverables
* The results help define **realistic scope, timeline, and risks** for the architecture project.

---

#### **7. Key Takeaways for Exam**

* Capability Assessment focuses on **the enterpriseâ€™s ability to perform architecture work**, not the architecture itself.
* It identifies **organizational strengths and weaknesses** influencing ADM success.
* Provides input for **risk management** and **transformation planning**.
* Supports **continuous capability improvement** across architecture cycles.

---

âœ… **In summary:**
The *Capability Assessment* ensures that an enterprise has the maturity, resources, and structure to successfully undertake architectural change. It is a key diagnostic step in Phase A of the ADM, aligning the organization's internal capability with transformation goals.
