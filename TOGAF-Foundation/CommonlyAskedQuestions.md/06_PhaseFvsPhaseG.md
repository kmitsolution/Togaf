---

## **1️⃣ Purpose Context**

| Phase                                   | Main Focus                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase F – Migration Planning**        | *Planning when and how the target architecture will be implemented* |
| **Phase G – Implementation Governance** | *Governing and controlling the actual implementation*               |

## **3️⃣ Key Differences in Simple Words**

### **Phase F**

* Planning phase
* Focuses on **when & sequence**
* Produces **roadmaps and migration plans**

### **Phase G**

* Governance phase
* Focuses on **compliance & control**
* Produces **contracts, reviews, and approvals**

---

## **4️⃣ Easy Memory Trick (Exam Friendly)**

* **Phase F = “Plan the Journey”**
* **Phase G = “Check the Journey”**

or

* **F → Schedule & Roadmap**
* **G → Govern & Approve**

---

## **5️⃣ One-Line Exam Answers**

* **Phase F:** Produces time-based migration plans and architecture roadmaps.
* **Phase G:** Produces governance artifacts to ensure implementation complies with the approved architecture.

---

## **6️⃣ Common Exam Trap (Important)**

❌ *“Phase G implements the solution”* → **Incorrect**
✅ *“Phase G governs the implementation”* → **Correct**
