# **📘 Phase G – Are we implementing or just approving?**

### **❌ Architects do NOT implement the solution in Phase G.**

### **✅ Phase G is about *governing* the implementation, not doing the implementation.**

---

## **What Happens in Phase G (Implementation Governance)**

In Phase G:

* **Projects and delivery teams implement the solution**
* **Architecture team provides governance and oversight**

So the implementation **does happen**, but **NOT by the architecture team**.

## **Role Clarity**

| Activity                       | Who Does It?                     |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Coding / configuration         | Project / delivery teams         |
| Infrastructure deployment      | Operations / platform teams      |
| Architecture compliance review | Architecture team                |
| Approval / waiver decisions    | Architecture Board               |
| Architecture guidance          | Enterprise / Solution Architects |

---

## **What Phase G DOES**

* Reviews implementations against approved architecture
* Issues **Architecture Contracts**
* Approves or rejects deviations
* Provides architecture guidance
* Ensures alignment with Architecture Vision and Roadmap

---

## **What Phase G DOES NOT DO**

❌ Design new architectures
❌ Create migration plans
❌ Perform development or deployment
❌ Run systems in production

---

## **Simple Real-World Analogy**

> **Architect designs the building**
> **Contractor builds it**
> **Architect inspects and approves construction against the blueprint**

Phase G = **Inspection & governance**, not construction.

---

## **🧠 One-Line Exam Answer**

**In Phase G, implementation is carried out by delivery teams while the architecture team governs and approves compliance with the approved architecture.**

---

## **Exam Tip**

If a question mentions:

* **Compliance reviews**
* **Architecture contracts**
* **Approvals / waivers**

👉 The answer is **Phase G**, not Phase E or F.
