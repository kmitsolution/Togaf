## üìä (2/3) **Platform Decomposition Diagram**

### ‚úÖ **Purpose:**

* Shows **technology platforms** that support **enterprise applications**.
* Helps **visualize the breakdown** of technology infrastructure.
* Often maps **applications to platform components** or deployment layers.

### üìå **Key Features:**

* Organized by **functional or process area** (e.g., Business Intelligence, Automation)
* May include:

  * Specific **technology components**
  * **Product versions**
  * **Hardware specs** (e.g., CPU, memory)

### üß© **Example View:**

#### Business Process Automation

* **Workflow Automation**
* **Application Connectors**
* **Event Triggers**
* **Subscription Services**

#### Business Intelligence

* **ETL**
* **Data Warehouse**
* **Operational Reporting**
* **Historical Reporting**

This diagram helps architects and engineers see **what platforms exist**, how they relate to **application functionality**, and where modernization or consolidation may be needed.

## üó∫Ô∏è (3/3) **Environments & Location Diagram**

### ‚úÖ **Purpose:**

* Shows **where** technologies are deployed ‚Äî across **sites, regions, data centers, or cloud environments**.
* Supports decisions related to **networking, latency, compliance, and resilience**.

### üìå **Common Uses:**

* Mapping technologies to:

  * **On-prem** vs **Cloud**
  * **Production**, **Test**, **Development**, **Disaster Recovery**
  * **Global business locations**
* Identifies **gaps** or **inconsistencies** in tech deployment

### üß© **Example:**

| Location           | Technology Deployed                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Frankfurt DC       | Data Warehouse, ETL, CRM Backend           |
| Singapore Office   | Lightweight Workflow Automation Client     |
| AWS Ireland        | Application Connectors, Reporting Services |
| DR Site (Virginia) | Standby Database, Event Trigger Framework  |
