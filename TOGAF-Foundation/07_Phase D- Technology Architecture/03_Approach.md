## ðŸ”· (1/2) **The Role of Emerging Technologies**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Idea:**

Emerging technologies are **not just support tools** â€” they can **drive innovation, transform business models**, and become **strategic assets**.

---

### âœ… **Key Considerations:**

| Topic                                     | Description                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Anticipate Technology-Driven Change**   | Stay ahead of the curve; monitor and assess emerging trends (e.g., AI, blockchain, quantum computing, edge computing).       |
| **Proactive Innovation**                  | Use technology to **improve business operations**, create new offerings, and optimize processes.                             |
| **Architectureâ€™s Role in Transformation** | The Technology Architecture should **identify and enable transformation opportunities** created by new tech.                 |
| **TOGAFâ€™s Position**                      | ADM empowers technology to be a **driver of change**, not just a **passive recipient** of change requests from the business. |
| **Dual Role of Technology Architecture**  | It both: <br> - **Drives new business capabilities** <br> - **Supports existing Data & Application requirements**            |
| **Caution**                               | Rapid adoption can cause **discontinuity**, technical debt, or misalignment across the enterprise. Manage change carefully.  |

---

## ðŸ”„ **Takeaway:**

Your Technology Architecture should be **flexible**, **forward-looking**, and **connected** to both business innovation and core operational needs.

---

## ðŸ”· (2/2) **Re-use of Internal and External Resources**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Key Idea:**

**Donâ€™t reinvent the wheel** â€” re-use trusted, existing architecture assets from both internal repositories and industry frameworks.

---

### âœ… **Sources for Re-use:**

| Source                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Internal IT Service Catalog**        | Re-use **existing technology services** already documented (e.g., in CMDBs, service catalogs).                                                                                                                                                |
| **Architecture Repository**            | Leverage enterprise-specific architecture views, models, and technology standards from past work.                                                                                                                                             |
| **Generic Industry Technology Models** | Use common architecture patterns, technology stacks, and integration models tailored to your **industry sector** (e.g., healthcare, telecom, finance).                                                                                        |
| **Open Group Reference Models**        | Apply proven frameworks like: <br> - **TRM (Technical Reference Model)**: Provides a **generic platform taxonomy** <br> - **III-RM (Integrated Information Infrastructure RM)**: Supports **interoperability and integration** across systems |

## ðŸ§© **Benefits of Re-use**

* **Saves time and effort**
* **Ensures consistency** across projects and architecture layers
* **Supports standardization** and compliance
* Reduces **integration risk** and technical debt
