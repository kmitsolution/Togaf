# üß± ADM ‚Äì **Phase D: Technology Architecture**

### üîß **Technology Architecture = Foundation for Delivery**

This phase defines **how technology infrastructure** (platforms, networks, systems) will **enable** and **support** the Business, Data, and Application Architectures defined in previous phases.

---

## üéØ **Purpose of Phase D**

> Same as in **Phase B (Business Architecture)**:

* To **develop the Target Architecture** for the domain (here: Technology)
* To **demonstrate business value**
* To **enable delivery** of strategic objectives via architecture

More specifically for Technology Architecture:

> **‚ÄúDevelop the Target Technology Architecture to support an agreed Architecture Vision.‚Äù**

This includes selecting and defining:

* **Technology components**
* **Technology services**
* **Infrastructure platforms**
* Ensuring alignment with the **Architecture Vision** and all stakeholder concerns

## üéØ **Objectives of Phase D**

| Objective                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ **1. Develop the Target Technology Architecture** | Define the necessary **technology infrastructure** (e.g., servers, networks, platforms, middleware) to support Business, Data, and Application Architectures.                                     |
| ‚úÖ **2. Align with the Architecture Vision**         | Ensure that the Technology Architecture supports strategic goals and the **Statement of Architecture Work**.                                                                                      |
| ‚úÖ **3. Address Stakeholder Concerns**               | Design with attention to performance, scalability, security, cost, and integration.                                                                                                               |
| ‚úÖ **4. Identify Roadmap Components**                | Perform a **gap analysis** between Baseline and Target Technology Architectures to identify: <br> - Required technology changes <br> - Transition steps <br> - Technology projects or initiatives |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technology Architecture Scope**

It typically covers:

* **Infrastructure services** (e.g., hosting, storage, compute)
* **Platform services** (e.g., runtime environments, containers)
* **Network architecture** (e.g., cloud, edge, internal networks)
* **Technology standards & reference models**
* **Security infrastructure**

## üìå Key Inputs from Previous Phases

| From Phase  | Input                                                           |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase A** | Architecture Vision, Stakeholder Concerns                       |
| **Phase B** | Business Architecture Building Blocks (Processes, Capabilities) |
| **Phase C** | Data & Application Architecture (Systems, Interfaces, Entities) |

---
