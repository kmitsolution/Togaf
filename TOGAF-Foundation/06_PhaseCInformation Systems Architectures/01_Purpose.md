Here's a clear and structured breakdown of **TOGAF® ADM – Phase C: Information Systems Architectures – Purpose**, based on your content and TOGAF guidance:

---

## **TOGAF ADM – Phase C: Information Systems Architectures – Purpose**

---

### 🎯 **Overall Purpose**

To **define the Target Data and Application Architectures** that will:

* **Support the Business Architecture** (defined in Phase B)
* Align with the **Architecture Vision** (defined in Phase A)
* Address **stakeholder concerns** and the **Statement of Architecture Work**
* Enable the enterprise to achieve **its business goals** through appropriate information systems

---

### 🧱 **Two Sub-Phases (Can Be Done in Either Order)**

| Sub-Phase                       | Purpose                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Application Architecture** | Describes the major types and interactions of application systems that support the business functions. |
| **2. Data Architecture**        | Describes the structure of the enterprise’s data assets and data management resources.                 |

---

## 🧭 **Key Objectives**

1. **Develop the Target Information Systems Architectures (Data & Application)**

   * Define **how Information Systems will enable** business processes and strategies.
   * Ensure alignment with **stakeholder needs** and **architecture requirements**.
   * Describe **services**, **systems**, and **data flows** needed to support the Business Architecture.

2. **Identify Candidate Architecture Roadmap Components**

   * Analyze **gaps** between:

     * **Baseline Architectures** (current state)
     * **Target Architectures** (desired future state)
   * Determine **transition architecture steps**.
   * Define **work packages**, **projects**, or **building blocks** to be included in the **Architecture Roadmap** (used in Phase E).

---

## 📥 **Key Inputs**

* **Statement of Architecture Work**
* **Baseline Business Architecture** and **Target Business Architecture** (from Phase B)
* **Architecture Vision**
* **Architecture Principles, Policies, and Constraints**
* **Architecture Repository Assets** (e.g., reference models, patterns)

---

## 📤 **Key Outputs**

* **Target Data Architecture**
* **Target Application Architecture**
* **Gap Analysis** (between Baseline and Target)
* **Data & Application Architecture Models**
* **Architecture Definition Document** (updated)
* **Architecture Requirements Specification** (updated)
* **Candidate Architecture Roadmap Components**

---

## 🛠️ **Modeling and Artifacts Examples**

### 📂 **Data Architecture Models**

* Data Entity/Data Component Catalog
* Data Flow Diagrams
* Data Lifecycle Diagrams
* Data Migration Diagrams
* Data Security Models

### 📲 **Application Architecture Models**

* Application Portfolio Catalog
* Interface Catalog
* Application Communication Diagrams
* Application Use-Case Diagrams
* Application Interaction Matrices

---

## 🔄 **Iterative Development & Reuse**

* May be developed **iteratively and incrementally**.
* Leverage **existing architecture artifacts**, **industry reference models**, and **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)** from the **Architecture Repository**.

---

## 🧩 **Key Considerations**

* Ensure consistency and integration with the **Business Architecture**.
* Data and Application Architectures must support:

  * **Business capabilities**
  * **Processes**
  * **Value streams**
* Think ahead: Consider **Technology Architecture** needs (Phase D) and **implementation constraints**.
