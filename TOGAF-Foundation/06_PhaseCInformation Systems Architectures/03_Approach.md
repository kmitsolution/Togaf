Here's a concise and structured summary of the **TOGAFÂ® ADM â€“ Phase C: Application and Data Architecture â€“ Approach**, combining your notes with key principles from TOGAF. This helps clarify how to **approach architecture development** in this phase, and what considerations to keep in mind.

# ðŸ§± ADM â€“ Phase C: Application & Data Architecture â€“ Approach

---

## ðŸ”· Overview

Phase C of the TOGAF ADM is concerned with developing the **Information Systems Architectures**, specifically:

* **Application Architecture**
* **Data Architecture**

These can be developed **in either order**, depending on context and project needs.

---

## ðŸ§© **Application Architecture â€“ Approach**

### âœ… **Key Focus Areas**

* Support **high-level business functions** with appropriate application components
* Align applications with **business processes**, **services**, and **data needs**

### ðŸ”§ **How to Approach It**

1. **Use Relevant Application Models**:

   * Based on **industry-standard functions** (e.g., e-commerce, CRM, billing)
   * Tailored to **your sector or organization**

2. **Leverage Industry Resources**:

   * Use **generic business and application models** from trusted sources:

     * **The Open Group** â€“ Reference Models (e.g., **III-RM** â€“ Integrated Information Infrastructure Reference Model)
     * **Object Management Group (OMG)** â€“ [https://www.omg.org/](https://www.omg.org/)
     * **TM Forum** â€“ [https://www.tmforum.org/](https://www.tmforum.org/)

3. **Apply the III-RM Reference Model**:

   * Focuses on **application-level components and services** needed for:

     * Seamless information flow
     * Integrated infrastructure
     * Business service enablement

## ðŸ“Š **Data Architecture â€“ Approach (1/2)**

### âœ… **Key Considerations**

Developing a strong Data Architecture requires attention to three main areas:

---

### 1. **Data Management**

* Define **Master Data** responsibilities (Which apps are the system of record?)
* Understand how data supports:

  * **Business capabilities**
  * **Business functions and services**
  * **Application services**
* Map **data lifecycle**: Where is data **created, stored, used, transferred, and reported**?

---

### 2. **Data Migration**

* Identify what data needs to be **migrated**, and how
* Address:

  * **Data cleansing**, **weeding**, and **transformation**
  * Migration **constraints** and **risks**
* Promote **standardized enterprise data definitions** to enable consistent and successful data transformation

---

### 3. **Data Governance**

* Ensure proper **data ownership**, **stewardship**, and **governance structures**
* Implement necessary:

  * **Policies**
  * **Processes**
  * **Management systems**
  * **Roles (e.g., data stewards, data custodians)**
* Governance is critical to **enable and sustain transformation** and data quality

| Aspect          | Application Architecture                                                      | Data Architecture                                                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Goal**        | Identify and structure application components that support business functions | Define how enterprise data is structured, used, and governed         |
| **Resources**   | Industry models (e.g., III-RM), Open Group, OMG, TM Forum                     | Data management frameworks, data standards, enterprise data catalogs |
| **Focus Areas** | Application components, integration, support for business processes           | Data entities, master data, migration strategy, governance           |
| **Key Outputs** | App Portfolio, Use Case Diagrams, Communication Diagrams                      | Data Catalogs, Lifecycle Diagrams, Migration Plans                   |
