### üìà **Diagrams**

| Artifact                                    | Purpose                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application Communication Diagram**       | Illustrates how applications communicate (interfaces, protocols, possibly linked to data entities or services). Logical view preferred unless tech is relevant. |
| **Application and User Location Diagram**   | Shows physical distribution of applications and user groups. Important for deployment, performance, and compliance.                                             |
| **Application Use-Case Diagram**            | Describes specific application functionality supporting business processes or user interactions.                                                                |
| **Enterprise Manageability Diagram**        | Highlights application components and their operational management needs (monitoring, maintenance).                                                             |

# üîÅ ADM ‚Äì Phase C: Application Architecture ‚Äì Artifacts (3/4)

## üí¨ **Application Communication Diagram**

* **Focus:** Shows how **applications interact** with each other.
* **Key Points:**

  * Interfaces can be linked to **data entities**
  * Applications can be tied to **business services**
  * Technology should be shown **only when relevant**
  * Logical views preferred over infrastructure detail unless needed

# üè¢ ADM ‚Äì Phase C: Application Architecture ‚Äì Artifacts (4/4)

## üß© **Application / Organization Matrix**

* **Purpose:** Maps which **organization units** use which **applications**
* **Benefits:**

  * Helps define **application support requirements**
  * Identifies **missing or redundant applications**
  * Supports **gap analysis** and rationalization efforts
  * Aids in planning for change (e.g., mergers, restructures)

---

# üìù Summary: Key Takeaways

* Start with the **Application Portfolio Catalog** as the **foundation**.
* Use **matrices** to understand **relationships** and dependencies.
* Use **diagrams** for **communication**, **planning**, and **visualization**.
* Prioritize **logical representations**, but include physical/technical views where necessary.
* Ensure all artifacts **support traceability** to the **Business Architecture** and **stakeholder needs**.
