## **ADM – Requirements Management – Approach**

The Requirements Management process **continuously drives the ADM**, ensuring that architecture development is aligned with evolving business needs.

---

### **Approach (1/2) – Process Overview**

* A **dynamic process** to identify, store, and manage enterprise architecture requirements and their changes.
* **Feeds requirements into and out of relevant ADM phases** as well as across ADM cycles.
* **ADM phases themselves** handle, address, or prioritize requirements—the Requirements Management process only manages and distributes them.

---

### **Approach (2/2) – Tools and Repository**

* Use an **Architecture Requirements Repository** to record and manage all architecture requirements (recommended).
* The **Architecture Requirements Repository**:

  * Can store requirements from **multiple ADM cycles**.
  * Unlike the **Architecture Requirements Specification** or **Requirements Impact Assessment**, it provides a long-term, centralized store for requirements.

---

This ensures that requirements are **continuously tracked, reusable, and available** to all ADM phases, enabling a consistent and traceable architecture development process.

I can now create a **complete, exam-ready TOGAF ADM reference sheet** covering:

* Requirements Management (Purpose, Objectives, Steps, Approach, Repository)
* Phases G & H (Implementation Governance, Architecture Change Management, Compliance, Change Requests)
* Requirements Impact Assessment
