## **ADM – Requirements Management Phase – Steps**

The Requirements Management phase ensures that **architecture requirements are actively maintained, updated, and integrated** into all ADM phases.

---

### **Steps (6–8)**

6. **Assess Impact of Changed Requirements**

   * Evaluate how changes affect previous and current ADM phases.
   * Decide whether to implement the changes in the current or a future ADM cycle.
   * Generate a **Requirements Impact Statement** (version n+1).

7. **Implement Requirements Arising from Phase H**

   * Incorporate changes from Architecture Change Management into the ADM process.

8. **Update the Architecture Requirements Repository**

   * Include changes and the affected stakeholder views.

### **Steps (9–10)**

9. **Implement Changes**

   * Apply approved requirements changes to the architecture.

10. **Conduct Gap Analysis for Past Phases**

* Identify gaps, such as missing or inadvertently excluded requirements.
* Record gap requirements in the **Architecture Requirements Repository**.
* Revise the **Target Architecture** to address identified gaps.

This process ensures **continuous alignment between evolving requirements and the architecture**, maintaining traceability and completeness across all ADM phases.
