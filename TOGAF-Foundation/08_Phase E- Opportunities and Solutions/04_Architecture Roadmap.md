## **Architecture Roadmap**

### **Overview**

* The **Architecture Roadmap** represents the **planned evolution** of the enterprise architecture from the **Baseline** to the **Target state**.
* It outlines **how the target architecture will be achieved** through a series of **transition architectures** and **work packages** over time.

---

### **Purpose**

* Serves as the **strategic guide** for implementing the architecture vision.
* Helps stakeholders understand **timelines, dependencies, and milestones**.
* Aligns **business, application, data, and technology initiatives** under a coherent plan.
* Provides a **communication tool** for management and governance to monitor progress.

---

### **Definition**

* A **time-sequenced plan** showing how the enterprise will move from the current (Baseline) to the desired (Target) architecture.
* Integrates **projects, work packages, and transition architectures** into a single roadmap.
* Developed during **Phase E** and refined in **Phase F (Migration Planning)**.

### **Structure**

Typical Architecture Roadmap includes:

1. **Baseline Architecture** – current operational environment.
2. **Transition Architectures** – interim steps to reach the target state.
3. **Target Architecture** – desired end-state.
4. **Work Packages and Projects** – discrete efforts to implement changes.
5. **Milestones and Dependencies** – key deliverables and sequencing.
6. **Timelines and Priorities** – project order and estimated duration.

---

### **Key Concepts**

* **Work Package:** A collection of tasks or changes necessary to realize part of the target architecture.
* **Transition Architecture:** Intermediate architectural state that bridges the gap between baseline and target.
* **Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs):** Logical components designed earlier, realized through Solution Building Blocks (SBBs) in the roadmap.

---

### **Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* Created in **Phase E** to visualize opportunities and sequencing.
* Finalized and validated in **Phase F** as part of the **Implementation and Migration Plan**.
* Used in **Phase G (Implementation Governance)** and **Phase H (Architecture Change Management)** for progress tracking and alignment with governance.

---

### **Benefits**

* Provides a **clear transformation path**.
* Enables **incremental delivery** through transition architectures.
* Facilitates **prioritization and funding decisions**.
* Improves **stakeholder communication** and **expectation management**.
* Acts as a **baseline for migration planning and project governance**.
