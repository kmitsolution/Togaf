## **Implementation and Migration Plan**

### **Overview**

* The **Implementation and Migration Plan (IMP)** defines *how the Target Architecture will be realized* through a series of **projects, phases, and transition architectures**.
* It is first developed in **Phase E** and then **finalized in Phase F (Migration Planning)**.
* It connects architectural design to **execution**, ensuring that strategy turns into actionable steps.

---

### **Purpose**

* To **translate the Architecture Roadmap** into a practical, executable plan.
* To coordinate **implementation projects** across business, data, application, and technology domains.
* To support **investment decision-making** and **change management** by providing structured prioritization.
* To ensure **alignment between business goals, architecture objectives, and project execution**.

---

### **Definition**

* The Implementation and Migration Plan specifies:

  * **What** needs to be implemented (scope and deliverables).
  * **When** it will occur (schedule and sequence).
  * **Who** will be responsible (roles and ownership).
  * **How** it aligns with other enterprise initiatives (dependencies, governance, risks).

### **Structure**

A typical Implementation and Migration Plan includes:

1. **Introduction and Objectives** – purpose, scope, and linkage to architecture vision.
2. **Summary of Work Packages and Transition Architectures** – description of incremental implementation steps.
3. **Project Sequencing** – order of execution based on dependencies, cost, and business value.
4. **Resource Requirements** – estimated budget, skills, and technology needed.
5. **Risk and Impact Assessment** – major risks and mitigation strategies.
6. **Governance Framework** – accountability, performance tracking, and change control.
7. **Schedule and Milestones** – key dates and checkpoints for review.

### **Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* **Created in Phase E** as an initial draft (strategic view).
* **Finalized in Phase F**, integrating detailed cost, benefit, and risk analysis.
* **Used in Phase G (Implementation Governance)** to ensure delivery aligns with architecture.
* **Updated in Phase H (Architecture Change Management)** to adapt to evolving needs and conditions.

---

### **Outputs**

* Draft and finalized **Implementation and Migration Plan** documents.
* Inputs to **project portfolio management**, **governance**, and **budget planning**.
* Clear linkage between **architecture work packages and organizational change activities**.
