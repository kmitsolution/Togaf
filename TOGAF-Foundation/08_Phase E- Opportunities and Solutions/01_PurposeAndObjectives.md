## **ADM – Phase E: Opportunities and Solutions **

### **Purpose **

* Bridge between architecture design (Phases B–D) and implementation planning (Phases F–H).
* Identify key implementation projects and transition architectures.
* Determine how the Target Architecture will be realized through projects, programs, or portfolios.
* Consolidate the gaps identified in previous phases and convert them into solution opportunities.

**Key goals**

* Generate the **Architecture Roadmap** (initial draft).
* Identify **Transition Architectures** to move from Baseline to Target.
* Define **Work Packages** and **major implementation projects**.
* Assess **dependencies, costs, and benefits** of each option.

### **Objectives **

1. Finalize the **Target Architecture** with solution options.
2. Evaluate and select the **best-fit implementation approach**.
3. Identify **major work packages and projects**.
4. Estimate **costs, benefits, and risks** for each project.
5. Produce an initial **Implementation and Migration Plan** draft.
6. Align with organizational **portfolio/program management**.
7. Secure stakeholder agreement on proposed solutions.

---

### **Steps **

1. **Confirm Business Principles, Goals, and Drivers** alignment.
2. **Identify major implementation projects** and transition points.
3. **Group related changes into Work Packages.**
4. **Assess dependencies and priorities.**
5. **Create a draft Architecture Roadmap** linking Work Packages and Transition Architectures.
6. **Develop initial Implementation and Migration Plan.**
7. **Review and validate** with stakeholders and governance teams.

*Outputs:*

* Architecture Roadmap (initial version)
* Draft Implementation and Migration Plan
* Updated Architecture Definition and Requirements Repository

### **Interoperability **

* Ensures **solutions work together seamlessly** across organizational boundaries.
* Focuses on data exchange, standards, and system integration.
* Critical for multi-system environments (e.g., merging applications or shared services).
* Considered throughout Phases C → E, influencing **Technology Architecture** and **Solution Design**.

**Four interoperability layers:**

1. **Business Interoperability** – aligned processes and business rules.
2. **Information Interoperability** – consistent data definitions and semantics.
3. **Application Interoperability** – integrated applications and APIs.
4. **Technology Interoperability** – compatible infrastructure and standards.

---

### **Key Outputs of Phase E**

* **Architecture Roadmap** – timeline of work packages.
* **Implementation and Migration Plan** (initial draft).
* **Transition Architectures** – interim target states.
* **Updated Architecture Requirements Specification.**
