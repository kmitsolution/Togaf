## **Architecture Contract**

### **Overview**

* The **Architecture Contract** formalizes the **agreement between the architecture function and implementation teams**.
* It defines how the **Target Architecture** will be realized in compliance with the TOGAF framework.
* Serves as a **governance tool** to ensure accountability, quality, and architectural alignment during execution.

---

### **Purpose**

* To ensure that **projects deliver solutions** consistent with the approved architecture.
* To establish **mutual responsibilities and deliverables** between architecture and development stakeholders.
* To act as a **reference for architecture compliance** throughout project execution.
* To **control deviations** and handle changes through formal governance.

### **Types of Architecture Contracts**

1. **Development Contract**

   * Agreement between the **architecture function** and **development organization**.
   * Focuses on ensuring solution development conforms to the **Architecture Definition**.

2. **Business Stakeholder’s Architecture Contract**

   * Agreement between the **architecture function** and **business sponsors or stakeholders**.
   * Ensures business goals and architecture outcomes are clearly understood and accepted.

### **Content of the Architecture Contract**

A complete Architecture Contract typically includes:

* **Introduction and Scope** – description of the architecture and involved parties.
* **Architecture Deliverables and Objectives** – outcomes to be achieved.
* **Compliance Requirements** – adherence to architectural principles, models, and standards.
* **Change Management Process** – handling deviations or refinements.
* **Governance and Review Mechanisms** – approval processes and performance metrics.
* **Responsibilities of Each Party** – roles of architects, developers, and sponsors.
* **Acceptance Criteria** – measures for evaluating successful implementation.

### **Statement of Architecture Work**

* The **Statement of Architecture Work (SoAW)** often serves as the **basis for the Architecture Contract**.
* Defines **what work will be done, by whom, and under what constraints**.
* Forms part of the **Architecture Definition Document** and ensures traceability between design and implementation.

---

### **Usage within the TOGAF ADM**

* **Created and agreed upon in Phase G** to guide implementation governance.
* Used throughout **implementation projects** to manage compliance and control change.
* **Reviewed and updated in Phase H** to accommodate evolving enterprise needs.

---

### **Benefits**

* Provides **clarity and control** over architecture implementation.
* Promotes **accountability and collaboration** between business and IT.
* Ensures **architecture alignment, consistency, and traceability**.
* Enables **effective governance and compliance management** during transformation.
