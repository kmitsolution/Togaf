## **ADM – Phase G: Implementation Governance**

### **Purpose**

Phase G focuses on deploying the Target Architecture in a controlled, incremental way, ensuring that implementation aligns with architectural objectives while delivering measurable business value.

---

### **Approach (1/2) – Incremental Deployment**

* Deploy the Target Architecture as a **series of transition steps** toward the final state.
* **Each step delivers business value** and enables early realization of benefits.
* **Minimize risks** in transformation and migration programs.
* Establish a structured **implementation program**.
* Use a **phased deployment schedule** aligned with business priorities.

---

### **Approach (2/2) – Governance and Operations**

* **Follow organizational standards** for corporate, IT, and architecture governance.
* Apply the organization’s established **portfolio/program management approach**.
* Define an **operations framework** to ensure the long-term effectiveness of deployed solutions.
* Develop **project details** including:

  * Project name and description
  * Acceptance criteria
  * Measures of effectiveness

---

### **Key Outcome**

* Phase G establishes the **connection between the architecture and the implementation organization** through the **Architecture Contract**, ensuring that implementation remains aligned with agreed architectural objectives and compliance requirements.
