## **Architecture Compliance Assessment (Deliverable) – Definition**

The Architecture Compliance Assessment deliverable ensures that the architecture is properly implemented and aligned with the organization’s strategic objectives.

**Key Objectives:**

* Verifies that the realized design and implementation conform to the Architecture Vision and architectural objectives.
* Ensures that lessons learned from implementation feed back into the architecture process.

---

## **Purpose**

* Provides an overview of project progress, status, and architecture/design.
* Uses architecture checklists to assess compliance in areas such as:

  * Hardware & operating systems
  * Software services and middleware
  * Applications
  * Information management
  * Security
  * System management
  * System engineering
  * Methods and tools

## **Content**

Brief description of TOGAF deliverables related to the Compliance Assessment in different ADM phases:

**Compliance Assessment Deliverable**

* Scope the Implementation Project and work packages addressing architecture gaps.
* Confirm that Architecture Requirements Specifications have been followed.
* Assess realized value by linking stakeholder requirements to specified constraints.

---

## **Usage within TOGAF ADM**

* Primarily used in **Phase G (Implementation Governance)** and **Phase H (Architecture Change Management)**.

---

## **Architecture Compliance Review (Process)**

**Timing:**

* Conducted at project milestones or checkpoints, such as:

  * Project initiation
  * Initial design completion
  * Major design changes
  * Ad hoc reviews as needed
* Ensures errors or shortcomings are identified while there is still time to correct them.

**Resources & Roles:**

1. **Target Architecture Checklist** – Ensures architecture development compliance.

   * EA Practitioner assesses the Target Architecture.
   * Stakeholders approve it.
   * Negative responses lead to:

     1. Rework of the Target Architecture, or
     2. Cancellation of the Architecture Project.

2. **Implementation & Other Change Checklist** – Ensures implementation compliance.

   * EA Practitioner acts as:

     * **Auditor**: Performs compliance assessment.
     * **Architect**: Provides recommendations based on impact assessment.
   * Recommendations may:

     1. Enforce compliance.
     2. Provide temporary relief.
     3. Adjust the Target Architecture.

**Checklist Questions (Excerpt):**

1. Were the correct stakeholders identified?
2. Were constraints and guidance from superior architecture considered?
3. Do appropriate SMEs agree with the facts and interpretations?
4. Do constraints/guidance reflect stakeholder views and underlying architecture models and analyses?
