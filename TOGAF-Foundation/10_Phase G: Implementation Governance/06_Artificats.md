# **📘 Phase G – Implementation Governance Artifacts (TOGAF ADM)**

Phase G artifacts focus on **governing and controlling implementation** to ensure alignment with the approved architecture.

---

## **1️⃣ Governance & Contract Artifacts**

### **✔ Architecture Contract**

* Formal agreement between:

  * Architecture function
  * Implementation / delivery teams
* Defines:

  * Scope of implementation
  * Architecture compliance requirements
  * Standards and principles to follow
  * Roles and responsibilities

👉 **Key artifact of Phase G**

---

## **2️⃣ Compliance & Review Artifacts**

### **✔ Architecture Compliance Review Reports**

* Results of formal architecture compliance checks
* Identifies:

  * Compliant areas
  * Non-compliance issues
  * Required corrective actions

---

### **✔ Architecture Compliance Assessments**

* Ongoing assessment during implementation
* Ensures alignment with:

  * Target Architecture
  * Architecture Roadmap
  * Architecture Principles

---

## **3️⃣ Change Management Artifacts**

### **✔ Architecture Change Requests**

* Raised when implementation requires deviation
* Evaluated by the Architecture Board
* May lead to:

  * Approval
  * Waiver
  * Trigger to Phase H (Architecture Change Management)

---

### **✔ Approved Waivers / Exceptions**

* Formal approval for controlled deviations
* Includes justification and constraints

---

## **4️⃣ Updated Architecture Artifacts**

### **✔ Updated Architecture Repository**

* Reflects:

  * Approved changes
  * As-built architecture updates
* Keeps repository current

---

## **5️⃣ Guidance & Communication Artifacts**

### **✔ Architecture Guidance Notes**

* Clarifications or interpretations provided to delivery teams
* Helps resolve implementation ambiguities

---

### **✔ Implementation Governance Reports**

* Status reports for:

  * Architecture compliance
  * Risk
  * Issues
