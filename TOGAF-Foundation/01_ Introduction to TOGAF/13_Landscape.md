# **📘 What is the Architecture Landscape in TOGAF?**

In TOGAF, the **Architecture Landscape** provides a **high-level view** of all the architectures within an organization.
It shows **what architecture exists today**, **what is being developed**, and **what is planned for the future**.

Think of it as a **map of the entire enterprise architecture** across different time horizons.

---

# **🎯 Purpose of the Architecture Landscape**

The Architecture Landscape helps you:

* Understand the **current state** of the organization
* See **ongoing projects** and architecture development
* Plan the **future (target) architecture**
* Identify gaps, overlaps, or inconsistencies
* Provide visibility to stakeholders

---

# **📌 The Three Levels of the Architecture Landscape**

TOGAF organizes the landscape into **three levels**, each offering a different view:

### **1️⃣ Strategic Architecture**

* High-level, long-term view
* Aligned with business strategy and transformation
* Supports planning over **5–10 years**
* Example: Cloud-first strategy, enterprise-wide ERP transformation

### **2️⃣ Segment Architecture**

* Mid-level architecture
* Focused on a **specific business domain or capability**
* Example: Finance architecture, HR architecture, Customer Experience architecture

### **3️⃣ Capability Architecture**

* Very detailed, short-term view
* Supports **specific projects or solutions**
* Example: Designing a CRM solution, data lake platform, mobile app architecture

---

# **🗂 What Does the Architecture Landscape Include?**

It may contain:

* Baseline (As-Is) Architecture
* Target (To-Be) Architecture
* Transition Architectures
* Projects & work packages
* Architecture Building Blocks
* Reference Models
* Standards & guidelines

---

# **📘 Simple Definition (One Line)**

**The Architecture Landscape is a structured, layered view of the enterprise architecture across different levels and timelines—strategic, segment, and capability.**

---

# **🧠 Example of an Architecture Landscape**

Imagine a bank:

### **Strategic Architecture**

* Move 80% of systems to cloud
* Modernize core banking in next 5 years

### **Segment Architecture**

* Digital Banking segment
* Lending and Credit segment
* Payments segment

### **Capability Architecture**

* Mobile banking app upgrade project
* Data analytics platform project
* CRM enhancement project

Together, these form the **Architecture Landscape**.

Here is a **simple, clear text-based Architecture Landscape diagram** you can use in slides, notes, or teaching.
(If you want a **visual image diagram**, I can generate that too—just tell me!)

# **📌 How to Read This Diagram**

* **Strategic Architecture** sets the **vision**.
* **Segment Architecture** translates it into **domain-level architectures**.
* **Capability Architecture** provides **detailed blueprints** for projects and solutions.

This layered structure is what TOGAF calls the **Architecture Landscape**.
