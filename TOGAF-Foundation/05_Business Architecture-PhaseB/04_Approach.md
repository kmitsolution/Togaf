## **TOGAF ADM ‚Äì Phase B: Business Architecture ‚Äì Approach (1/2)**

### üî∑ **Role of Phase B in the ADM Cycle**

* **First architecture activity in BDAT (Business, Data, Application, Technology)** sequence.
* It **lays the foundation** for all subsequent architecture development.
* Critical to **demonstrate business value** and **justify ROI** of the entire architecture initiative to stakeholders.

## **Key Objectives**

| Objective                               | Description                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Define Target Business Architecture** | Describe the future state of the business, aligned with strategic goals.                  |
| **Identify Gaps**                       | Understand the difference between current (baseline) and future (target) business states. |
| **Inform Subsequent Phases**            | Guide Data, Application, and Technology architecture development.                         |
| **Showcase Business Value**             | Prove alignment to business goals to gain stakeholder buy-in.                             |

## **Two Common Scenarios**

### ‚úÖ **Case 1: Existing Business Architecture**

* **Action:** Verify, validate, and update existing models.
* **Focus:** Bridge gaps between:

  * **High-level strategic goals**
  * **Specific business requirements**
* **Output:** Refined and aligned business models ready for deeper architectural development.

---

### ‚ùå **Case 2: No or Minimal Business Architecture**

* **Action:** Conduct business analysis to:

  * Understand key objectives
  * Identify core business processes
  * Gain **stakeholder buy-in**
* **Approach:**

  * Interview stakeholders
  * Review business strategy documents
  * Map capabilities and value streams from scratch if needed

---

## **Key Inputs and Resources**

* **Architecture Vision (from Phase A)**: Starting point for identifying business goals and concerns.
* **Architecture Repository**:

  * Industry reference models
  * Enterprise-specific assets
  * Standards
  * Architecture Building Blocks (ABBs)

---

## **Business Architecture Deliverables / Models**

Develop or refine the following (where applicable):

| Model                       | Description                                                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Business Capability Map** | Shows "what" the business does; helps identify strategic focus areas.         |
| **Value Stream Model**      | Maps "how" value flows through the organization from stakeholder perspective. |
| **Organization Map**        | Depicts business units and their relationships.                               |
| **Business Process Models** | Describes key business processes (can use BPMN or UML¬Æ).                      |

---

## **Modeling Techniques**

Use suitable modeling notations and tools, such as:

* **UML¬Æ**: For structure and behavior diagrams (use case, activity, class, etc.)
* **BPMN**: For detailed process models
* **ArchiMate¬Æ**: For high-level integrated views

---

## **Guidance and Best Practices**

* Ensure alignment with **business strategy**.
* Involve **business stakeholders early** and throughout.
* Focus on **capability and value delivery** rather than just processes.
* Leverage reusable assets to **accelerate development**.
* Constantly check if the **fundamental view of the business is shifting**.
