#### **2. Steps in Developing the Business Architecture**

| Step                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Select Reference Models, Viewpoints, and Tools**                              | Identify suitable **business architecture frameworks** (e.g., TOGAF Content Framework, ArchiMate, BPMN). Choose viewpoints that best represent stakeholder concerns. |
| **2. Develop Baseline Business Architecture Description**                          | Document the **current state** of business capabilities, processes, and organizational structure. Use existing documentation and interviews.                         |
| **3. Develop Target Business Architecture Description**                            | Define the **future state** of business operations aligned with strategic objectives. Describe target capabilities, organization, and business processes.            |
| **4. Perform Gap Analysis**                                                        | Identify **differences** between baseline and target architectures. Highlight capability gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement.                      |
| **5. Define Candidate Roadmap Components**                                         | Identify potential **projects or initiatives** needed to move from baseline to target. Prioritize based on value, cost, and feasibility.                             |
| **6. Resolve Impacts Across the Architecture Landscape**                           | Ensure consistency and alignment with data, application, and technology architectures. Address dependencies and integration points.                                  |
| **7. Conduct Formal Stakeholder Review**                                           | Review business architecture deliverables with stakeholders to ensure clarity, alignment, and approval.                                                              |
| **8. Finalize the Architecture**                                                   | Incorporate feedback and finalize models and documentation.                                                                                                          |
| **9. Create the Architecture Definition Document (Business Architecture Section)** | Update the ADD with finalized baseline, target, and gap analysis for the business domain.                                                                            |
| **10. Conduct Architecture Compliance Review**                                     | Validate that the architecture adheres to principles, standards, and governance requirements.                                                                        |
